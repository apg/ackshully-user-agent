# Ackshully User-Agent

I recently stumbled into some web-sites that break under Firefox's more extreme (and correct!) Tracking Protection. The problem is that one of them is needed for my day to day. 

This extension allows you to opt-in, on the tab's current domain, to sending a more proper User-Agent string for your platform.
